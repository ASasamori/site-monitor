# URL Validation Improvements

## What was changed:

### Before:
- Red error appeared immediately when typing in URL field
- Validation triggered on every keystroke
- Poor user experience - errors showed while user was still typing

### After:
- Error only appears when user has typed something that looks like a complete URL but is invalid
- Specifically, error only shows if:
  - The input contains a dot (.) AND
  - The input is not a valid URL
- Full validation still occurs when user tries to submit
- Much better user experience

## Technical Details:

1. **Modified `handleUrlChange` and `handleNewUrlChange`** in `useFormHandlers.ts`:
   - Now only shows error if input contains a dot and is invalid
   - This prevents premature error display while typing

2. **Added `validateUrl` and `validateNewUrl` functions**:
   - These perform full validation when user tries to submit
   - Show appropriate error messages for empty or invalid URLs

3. **Updated submit handlers** in `App.tsx`:
   - Now use the validation functions instead of inline validation
   - Cleaner code and consistent error handling

## User Experience:

- ✅ No red error while typing anything (including dots, slashes, etc.)
- ✅ No red error while typing "example.com"
- ✅ No red error while typing "https://"
- ✅ Red error only appears when clicking "Start Monitoring" with invalid URL
- ✅ Error clears immediately when you start typing again
- ✅ Full validation on submit with clear error messages
